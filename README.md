## Overview

Math Quiz is an interactive command-line game where you select a multiplication table (the "multiple") and then answer 10 randomly generated questions. It's an excellent tool for students and anyone wanting to sharpen their mental math skills.

---

## How It Works

- You choose which multiplication table (e.g., 2, 5, 7, 12) you want to practice.
- The program generates 10 random multiplication questions based on your choice.
- For each question, you input your answer.
- If you're unsure, you can type `00000` (five zeros) to reveal the correct answer.
- After 10 questions, you receive your score and feedback.
- You can choose to play again or exit.

---

## Rules

1. **Choose a Multiple:**  
   When prompted, enter the number you want to test (e.g., 7 for the 7 times table).

2. **Answer Questions:**  
   For each question (e.g., `6 x 7`), type your answer and press Enter.

3. **Reveal the Answer:**  
   If you don't know the answer, type `00000` (exactly five zeros) to see the correct answer.

4. **Scoring:**  
   - One point for each correct answer.
   - No penalty for skipping (using `00000`), but you don't get a point.

5. **Feedback:**  
   After 10 questions, your score and feedback message are displayed.

6. **Play Again:**  
   Type `yes` to play again, or `no` to quit.
